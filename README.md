## Description:

This project is a simple implementation of blockchain technology via a decentralized wave-portal website with Solidity smart contract deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. The application will allow users to interact with the smart contract by sending a "wave" and message greeting. Users can see their message displayed on the webpage and are only required to connect to their crypto wallet on the Rinkeby testnet. Users also have a chance to win free ETH!
